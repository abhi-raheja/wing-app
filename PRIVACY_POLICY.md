# Wing Extension Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 2, 2026

## Overview
Wing is a Chrome extension that helps you save and organize web pages with optional AI-powered summaries, connections, and query features. This policy explains what data Wing processes and how it is handled.

## Data We Process
Wing processes the following types of data to provide its features:
- **Saved pages ("wings")**: page URL, title, favicon, timestamp, and (optionally) page content used for AI summarization.
- **User organization data**: collections, nests, tags, and relationships between saved pages.
- **Highlights and annotations**: selected text and your notes on those highlights.
- **AI queries and responses**: your prompts and the resulting answers.
- **API keys**: stored locally so you can use your chosen AI provider.

## How Data Is Used
Wing uses your data only to deliver the product features you initiate, such as:
- Generating summaries of pages you save.
- Finding connections between your saved pages.
- Answering your questions using your saved content.
- Restoring highlights when you revisit a saved page.

## Where Data Is Stored
All saved pages, collections, highlights, and settings are stored locally on your device using IndexedDB and Chrome storage. Wing does not run a backend service and does not collect or store your data on any Wing servers.

## Third-Party AI Providers
If you enable AI features, Wing sends relevant page content and/or your question to your selected AI provider (Anthropic or OpenAI) to generate summaries, connections, or answers. These requests are made directly from your browser to the provider using your API key.

## Data Retention
Your data remains on your device until you delete it or clear it using the in-product controls. You can also export or import your data at any time.

## Children’s Privacy
Wing is not intended for use by children under 13 and does not knowingly collect data from children.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date above.
