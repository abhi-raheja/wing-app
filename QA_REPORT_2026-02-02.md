# Wing Manual QA Report

**Date:** February 2, 2026  
**Tester:** Codex (automated/manual via Puppeteer)  
**Browser:** Chrome for Testing (Puppeteer). Google Chrome launch did not expose extension ID, so tests ran on Chromium-based Chrome for Testing.  
**OS:** macOS (host)  

## Summary

Manual QA focused on Sections 8, 9, 12, and 14 of `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`. Highlighting/annotations and both Anthropic + OpenAI AI query flows passed. Cross-site badge checks passed on 9 sites including strict CSP and iframe-heavy pages. Error handling edge cases passed, including offline AI query and offline winging (with expected summary failure toast while offline).
